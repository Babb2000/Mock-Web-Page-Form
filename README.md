Creating a form template, utilizing basic html structure


In this mini-project, I wanted to practice with some basic Html structure I learned this week. I wanted to focus most of my code on form fields within HTML, as that portion of code took a little more time. I also wanted to make navigating through a footer like "navbar" which would automatically scroll to the part of the webpage that was being referenced. Completing this part of the project was pretty straightforward. I had to create a tag with a reference link that was linked to the element's text to which I wanted to scroll. The id for the element was then connected to the href link text using a # sign followed by the keyword. Another thing to remember within form fields is that the name attribute is sent to the webserver with the value or selection the user does. So the name attribute and the value attribute need each other to effectively send data to the webserver.
